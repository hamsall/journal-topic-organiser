---Carpe Diem---

I had a interesting little walk in the park before. it was really focused on this concept of being clear about what I want, even when I was walking. usually i try to act polite and consider how other people are feeling when I'm walking along. But this time I just wandered and looked where I wanted to wander and look. it was a little strange at first, I felt a bit like a cranky lion stalking through regents park. but after a bit of time a sense of contentment washed over me, since i didn't care whether I looked cranky. I made me relaxed, yet focused, being very absorbed in the activity of walking. It was nice. 

Marley is a little bear and one that does not need a care because she is so ickle sweet a tasty little bareby treat.

Its 1121 and I'm writing a personal reference for the ministry of stories from Sammy. he can tweak it from here:

To the Ministry of Stories,
I'm writing to recommend my friend Sam Hall. I've known them for 6 years, and they're genuinely great to be around.
Sam has a knack for bringing out creativity in themselves and others. He's always coming up with new ideas and encouraging people to pursue their passions.
Beyond their creative side, Sam is reliable and supportive. He's the kind of person who shows up when it matters.
I'm sure Sam would be a fantastic addition to your Writing Mentor team. He brings energy and fresh perspectives to everything they do.
Feel free to reach out if you need more info.
Cheers,
Sam Clarke

While I'm here I might as well whip one up for a professional reference.

To the Ministry of Stories,
I'm writing to recommend Sam, who I worked with during their time as Founder of Nimbus Studio from February 2023 to May 2024 and who worked for me at CoreData before that.
Sam has a talent for bringing data to life. At Nimbus, they consistently delivered eye-catching infographics, animations, and interactive dashboards that made complex information accessible and engaging.
What impressed me most was their ability to lead teams while still rolling up their sleeves to get work done. They have a talent for fostering collaboration and bringing out the best in their colleagues.
Sam also has a keen eye for improving processes. They're not content with the status quo and often found innovative ways to streamline our workflows.
I'm confident Sam would be a valuable asset to any team. They bring a mix of creativity, leadership, and practical problem-solving that's hard to find.
Feel free to reach out if you need any more details.
Best regards,
Andrew Inwood

I've sent Andrew an email to see what he thinks about this without the write up. But I can send this along if he needs something.

its 1336. I'm going to head into the little room downstairs, nom on some nicotene gum, and get into it. nah dont be a baby. just get into it here at the dining table. It's 1343. I can feel a very small carb coma washing over me. it is not yet time to write today. I'll play guitar for a while and watch.

its 2003. i played guitar, made a payment system for busking and drew a qr code onto a piece of paper which is now stuck inside the guitar. It looks a bit businessy at the mo. I'll jazz it up later on. For now, let us play the words. 

before doing that, i think i'd like to read it back. like the whole thing. I know that'll take time, but I reckon needed, especially as I edit.

its 2106 and I've done a bit of work on the second draft. also im thinking of doing a chapter before this one, about oermanto talking to the darkness and disobeying the plan to try and jump to the acrhipelago before they're ready to invade.
