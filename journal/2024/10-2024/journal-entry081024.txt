---chat with Sam Clarke---

He's doing alot better. good things are happening with the business. learnt who and how to trust. 

Went to byron for five days. hung out with some 19 year old backpackers. then saw some mates in crescent head. sleeping in the van. Reading Will Durant history series. 11 parts. would love to read some one liners. 

keen to talk tomorrow when he gets on the ferry. around 730 my time.
